# kpi-oop-lab3
This work is a continuation of the second work (kpi-oop-lab2). In this program, classes are implemented as templates. Input/output operators are also overloaded (lab condition)

In the console window, you can create a new node and a new graph. The result of such operations as information output, adding and deleting a node for a graph, and searching for a path from one node to another will also be displayed on the screen.
